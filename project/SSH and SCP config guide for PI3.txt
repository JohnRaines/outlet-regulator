Note: as I am writing this guide on 11/21/16, I am using the latest 
distribution of Raspbian (Jessie lite ker: 4.4) and the latest version of 
windows 10. Depending on how things have advanced since then and your own
computer set up, steps may very. There are plenty of guides online on this 
subject but most are out of date or have mixed success. The guide I followed
is linked bellow, but I will transcribe most of the steps here for your convenience.

***********************
PART1:
SOFTWARE YOU WILL NEED:
***********************
~putty (http://www.putty.org/)
	~ssh client, will allow you to remotely access the command line of the pi
	 over lan

~WinSCP (https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)
	~scp client that will allow you to remotely copy files to and from the pi
	 over lan

PART2:
THE GUIDE
**********************
~Before you can connect via SSH you need to do some basic configuration steps

~step 1: navigate to "Network and Sharing Center" and procede to "change adapter settings"

~step 2: You will see a page with a summary of all the network connections you have. 
	 RIGHT CLICK on the one providing your interenet and go to properties, then to sharing.

~step 3: check the box "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection"
	 then restart your computer. This step allows your pi to connect to the internet via your computer
	 which is necesarry for the ssh connection.

~step 4: repeat step 1 and right click on your ethernet connection, then go to properties. You should see
	 a menu titled "this connection uses the following items". select "internet protocol version 4", go 
	 to it's properties, and verify that there is some IP address selected.

~step 5: plug in the pi via ethernet if you have not done so already. on the networks page you should see the 
	 ethernet connection update to "Unidentified Network". Also check and make sure that the communication 
	 lights on the pi's port are lit. 

~step 6: open the command prompt and type "ping raspberrypi.mshome.net". If the ping works, your pi is connected
 	 you're ready to SSH. Record the IP that responds because that will be the IP used for SCP later

~step 7: open Putty and enter either the ip you just recorded or "raspberrypi.mshome.net" in the hostname field
	 and open the connection. You will be prompted for a username and password. The pi default are
		username: pi
		password: raspberry (note: when entering the password, there is no indication that your inputs
					   are being recieved, just enter the password and hit enter)

~step 8: you should now be connected to the pi via SSH.

~step 9: install winscp and enter the IP address you recorded and the pi's username and password. SCP
	 is enabled by default on the version I'm using, so you should be able to immediately start copying
	 files to and from the pi over lan.
