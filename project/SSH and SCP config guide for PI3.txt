Note: as I am writing this guide on 11/21/16, I am using the latest 
distribution of Raspbian (Jessie lite ker: 4.4) and the latest version of 
windows 10. Depending on how things have advanced since then and your own
computer set up, steps may very. There are plenty of guides online on this 
subject but most are out of date or have mixed success. The guide I followed
is linked bellow, but I will transcribe most of the steps here for your convenience.

***********************
PART1:
SOFTWARE YOU WILL NEED:
***********************
~putty (http://www.putty.org/)
	~ssh client, will allow you to remotely access the command line of the pi
	 over lan

~WinSCP (https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)
	~scp client that will allow you to remotely copy files to and from the pi
	 over lan

only for method 2
~Apache httpd (https://httpd.apache.org/)
	~httpd server client that will allow you to make and host a site on a lan network
	 from your machine


**********************
PART2:
METHOD 1
**********************
~Before you can connect via SSH you need to do some basic configuration steps

~step 1: navigate to "Network and Sharing Center" and procede to "change adapter settings"

~step 2: You will see a page with a summary of all the network connections you have. 
	 RIGHT CLICK on the one providing your interenet and go to properties, then to sharing.

~step 3: check the box "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection"
	 then restart your computer. This step allows your pi to connect to the internet via your computer
	 which is necesarry for the ssh connection.

~step 4: repeat step 1 and right click on your ethernet connection, then go to properties. You should see
	 a menu titled "this connection uses the following items". select "internet protocol version 4", go 
	 to it's properties, and verify that there is some IP address selected.

~step 5: plug in the pi via ethernet if you have not done so already. on the networks page you should see the 
	 ethernet connection update to "Unidentified Network". Also check and make sure that the communication 
	 lights on the pi's port are lit. 

~step 6: open the command prompt and type "ping raspberrypi.mshome.net". If the ping works, your pi is connected
 	 you're ready to SSH. Record the IP that responds because that will be the IP used for SCP later

~step 7: open Putty and enter either the ip you just recorded or "raspberrypi.mshome.net" in the hostname field
	 and open the connection. You will be prompted for a username and password. The pi default are
		username: pi
		password: raspberry (note: when entering the password, there is no indication that your inputs
					   are being recieved, just enter the password and hit enter)

~step 8: you should now be connected to the pi via SSH.

~step 9: install winscp and enter the IP address you recorded and the pi's username and password. SCP
	 is enabled by default on the version I'm using, so you should be able to immediately start copying
	 files to and from the pi over lan.

			******WARNING******
			*******************
~Auburn University wifi has a grudge against linux devices. If you use this method on school
 wifi, they'll put a stop to it

**********************
PART3:
METHOD 2
**********************
~step 1: find a computer with a router that is not connected to the school's network (at the time of writing, there
	 is one such router in Broun 409)

~step 2: connect the pi to the router and power it on. once it's on the router will assign it a dynamic IP

~step 3: open the command line and ping "raspberrypi.local" to find the IP address of the pi on the local network

~step 4: use rsapberrypi.local or the IP you found from pinging it that to connect to it via putty or winscp on the 
	 computer associated with the router

~step 5: alternatively to step 4, connect your personal computer to the router and address the pi via the IP you found

~note: using this method the pi will not have internet access. You will have to set up an HTTP server on another machine
       on the local network to use the pi's network capabilities.

~NOTE ON SETTING UP APACHE:
	if you're using windows 10 or later, you're likely to see this error when trying to boot apache
	
	Error (OS 10013) An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions. :AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address [::]:80
	(OS 10013) An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions. :AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80
	AH00451: no listening sockets available, shutting down
	AH00015: Unable to open logs

	if you do, access services.msc and disable both the following (only 1 may be present)
		~Web Deployment Agent Service (MsDepSvc)
		~IIS / World Wide Web Publishing Service (W3SVC)

	this should solve that error.
